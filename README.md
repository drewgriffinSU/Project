# Introduction


# Why The Vatican Vergil?
The reason why I wanted to research The Vatican Vergil is because we see this style of text used everyday in the marketing world. The Vatican was the first of it's kind to present an image like this.

Never before did they incorperate images with meaninful text. This is a common trend in the marketing world because it gives the reader some context before even reading. It is proven that when advertising with just a block of text, a large percentage of the audience is not going to read it. Time is precious, you only have about 2 seconds to engage with somebody when marketings your product to them through a platform that is not you. When somebody is scrolling through their timeline, they are more likely to stop if your product is promoted with a attractive image, solid information, and something to catch them, like in the Vatican Vergile, the bright red outline. 



# Historical Context
The Vatican Vergil was beleived to be created for a wealthy artistocrate. Even though the text has been reduced over the years, it is still known to be the most impressive surviving example of illustrated classical literary text.The Vatican Vergile is composed of many images. In the earlier illustrated images, they would only have a title above the illustration. Pages were composed on parchment but were damaged for how often the Vatican Vergil was transported. This is another reason why the Vatican is so important. Illustrations could easily be created with parchment. Parchment is made normally from animal skins such as sheep, which made it available wherever they were (Which was everywhere). This made illustrations much more available. Originally, you would only find Illuminated manuscripts in certain gospel books. Overtime as it gradually became more popular, they would illuminate complete bibles. In the Vatican Vergil image we see the text placed above and the image below. However, it is known for it's bright red surrounding becuase it seperates itself from the rest of the text. This took craftsmenship and images like the Vatican Vergil were only found belonging to people of wealth. As this design begane to become more popular, it hit larger market cities like Paris. As we look at the Vatican Vergil, there isn't emply space between text and image. After writing the text, they would use any empty space for illustrations, giving it a clean and organized look.
