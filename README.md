# The Vatican Vergil
# Introduction
The world of marketing and advertising in constantly changing. Companies are constantly having to revamp the way they sell their products. The main focus is communication. How are you going to display your message to your audience? The Vatican Vergil is one of the last stadning historical texts and completely changed the way you display your message. It was the first to incorperate an image with text to draw the audience in. It covers the 3 key factors that we use in advertising today. An attention graber, an attractive image, and context. The Vatican Vergil draws you in with the red outline around the image, the image makes you curious to what this could be about, and the text sells you on what it really is. We refer to this today as an Affective Ad Appeal.

# Why The Vatican Vergil?
The reason why I wanted to research The Vatican Vergil is because this style of text is a very popular marketing stradegy today. With an increase in social media, research shows that 59% of global customers use social media as their motivation to purchase. A majority of social media is used to images like Instagram and Facebook. With people constantly on their phones, incorperating your prodcut with an image brings them in, then the text gives them more information. The main point is that consumers have an attention span of about 3 seconds, you can't sell them in 3 seconds on words, you need imagary. The Vatican was the first to incorperate this style of presenting a text.

# Historical Context
The Vatican Vergil was beleived to be created for a wealthy artistocrate. Even though the text has been reduced over the years, it is still known to be the most impressive surviving example of illustrated classical literary text.The Vatican Vergile is composed of many images. In the earlier illustrated images, they would only have a title above the illustration. Pages were composed on parchment but were damaged for how often the Vatican Vergil was transported. This is another reason why the Vatican is so important. Illustrations could easily be created with parchment. Parchment is made normally from animal skins such as sheep, which made it available wherever they were (Which was everywhere). This made illustrations much more available. Originally, you would only find Illuminated manuscripts in certain gospel books. Overtime as it gradually became more popular, they would illuminate complete bibles. In the Vatican Vergil image we see the text placed above and the image below. However, it is known for it's bright red surrounding becuase it seperates itself from the rest of the text. This took craftsmenship and images like the Vatican Vergil were only found belonging to people of wealth. As this design begane to become more popular, it hit larger market cities like Paris. As we look at the Vatican Vergil, there isn't emply space between text and image. After writing the text, they would use any empty space for illustrations, giving it a clean and organized look.


# The Adaptation
I work in marketing at my organization so I created a social media advertisment for one of our trusts. We actually ran this as a paid advertisment and received tremedous results. We are a health trust specifically desgined for construction/home builders in metropolitan portland. I used our logo with the construction workers because it connects insurance with construction. Then in my blurb, I talk about savings, expertise, and how great these employee benefits are. I've caught their attention, pitched them on the positives, and how they can receive a free quote instantly. The message is quick and straight to the point, only selling them on positives. Employee benefits is a confusing process and nobody likes to deal with it, the purpose of the ad is to make it sound easy and simple.

# Qualities
When creating the ad, I wanted to keep the image simple, yet attractive. I wanted the image to bring them in, and if they make it to the text that's great. I wanted to relate to them. In the second ad, I kept the same wording but changed the image. I used photoshop to turn out logo into a wood carving to relate to carpenters. I only used three words, Savings, Service, and Expertise. These 3 words summarize what the main compenents in my blurb. I wanted the auidence to see these with the wood logo, and think what is this? Then they go into the text to learn more. The focal point is the logo.

# Culteral Meaning
The overall message of my adaptation is to inform my audience about our health trust and our services. However, before I can do that I have to catch their attention. Stuart Hall argues that this is the problem with the culture we are developing. Our culture demands information now and they don't want to wait for it. Hall mentions that "journalism is dying, value is dying". With an increase in accessability to information, our culture no longer has the patients to wait or explore the deeper meaning. We live in a culture where we spend seconds trying to understand something and if we're not interested than we just throw it out. Hall finished by mentioning how this is getting worse and worse. We are more focused on spreading little amounts of information to a large audience, than taking the time to find the deeper meaning.


# Rhetorical Significance
My adapation is specificly targeting building industry companies in Metropolitan Portland. Debord states "the target audience of the communication is known as the receiver. A receiver can be identified as anyone who is taking in this information". Hey also mentiones how the receiver can take in the message through the text in multiple different ways. From my adaptation, you can relate to the construction industry by seeing the construction workers point to the logo which says "Building Industry Insurance Trust". They know they are the audience becuase it mentions it is for members that belong to the HBA of Portland. They also get a summary of the informatino for the key words in the image. Then they get the entire scope of the message in the blurb above the image. This ad is used to pursuad the receiver that they qualify for this trust and can be saving on their insurance preiums. 


# Reflection
1) If somebody viewed this outside of the class they would know that I am passionate about what I do. I used this project to help me getter a better understanding of my marketing role in my organization. The Vatican Vergile is the oldest text that we have where it incorperates illustration as a way of conveying your message. This is marketing 101 now but I wanted to get a better understanding of the importance of it and how it was developed. Then I created advertisments for my compnay based on the findings that I found during this project.

2) If I had all the time in the world, I would really want to make my adaptation stand out. I created the wood logo in photoshop after using it for 1 day. If I could spend more time understanding the platform, I think I could make something very appealing, because it's all about catching the audiences attention! Specifically in the Vatican Vergil, they used the red outline as their attention graber because they didn't have many resources. Now, I have an abundent amount of resources and I think I could alter that piece of my Adaptation to something more modern.

3) This project has opened my eyes to how I view the business world. Especially after diving into the impact our culture has on advertisments, everything is getting simpiler. As technology continues to grow it is going to be interesting how that impacts our culture. As somebody who grew up in this tech generation, I was blind to it. It also helped me compare older artifacts, and how they have impacted our world today.
